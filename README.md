---ConnectionString----

When the API first stands up, it will search for a database with the name you specify and add the tables there. The appsettings.json file needs to be edited
recording to locally created database.
For example I created a db with name WasteRegistration, so you can see that in my appsettings as below.

"ConnectionStrings": {
    "DatabaseConnection": "Data Source = ***** ; Initial Catalog = WasteRegistration; integrated security=true "
  },

---Migration----

Application is imported with migration file inside but if you wish Migration can be re-created by deleting it.
If you want to continue wih existing migration you must run update-database in command line window.
